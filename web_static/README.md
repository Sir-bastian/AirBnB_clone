project: AirBnB clone - Web static

In this phase of the Airbnb Clone project, we focus on the HTML and CSS components. Our project directory is organized into several key folders. The 'Images' folder houses essential icons and images, such as the logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, and guest icons. Meanwhile, the 'Styles' folder contains CSS styling files that define the look and feel of the website.

To streamline development and ensure clarity, we've structured our project in a way that makes it easy to identify the most relevant files. The highest-numbered style file in each category (e.g., 'common,' 'footer,' 'header,' 'places') represents the most up-to-date and significant styling for that particular section. Similarly, the highest-numbered 'index.html' file corresponds to the most current version of the website.

We're committed to delivering a high-quality Airbnb Clone that captures the essence of the platform while adding our unique touches. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the project, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support your journey in creating an outstanding Airbnb-inspired website.
